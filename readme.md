# Project README

## Overview

This project implements a feature selection strategy (FSS) using Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Additionally, it includes an implementation of Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) for multi-objective optimization. The code is primarily derived from Lab 6 and Lab 7, with additional modifications for the specific objectives of this project.

## Running the Application

### Running FSS with GA and PSO

To run the feature selection strategy using Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
streamlit run appw7ModifiedAgainAgain.py
```

### Running FSS with NSGA-II

To run the feature selection strategy using NSGA-II, use the following command:

```bash
streamlit run nsga.py
```

## Code Organization

The majority of the code for this project overlaps with the content from Lab 6 and Lab 7. These are organized into Jupyter notebooks, which are available in the two zip files attached to this project. These notebooks contain the original implementations, as well as any modifications made for this project.

### Notebooks in Zip Files:
- **Lab 6 Code**
- **Lab 7 Code**

## Presentation

A presentation is included with this project, which covers the results obtained from running the various optimization strategies. This presentation provides insights into the performance and effectiveness of the FSS techniques implemented.

## Requirements

To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Streamlit
- Required Python libraries (as specified in the notebooks)
